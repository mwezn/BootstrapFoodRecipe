      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Mix together the marinade ingredients in a small ovenproof dish, ideally cast iron, or a small roasting tin. Add the chicken and coat thoroughly in the marinade. Roast for 10 minutes.</li>

<li>While the chicken is cooking, make the sauce. Heat the sunflower oil in a medium non-stick frying pan and cook the garlic and ginger over a low heat for 1–2 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring constantly. Add the garam masala, cumin, coriander and turmeric and cook for 30 seconds, stirring.</li>

<li>Sprinkle over the fenugreek and chilli flakes and cook for a few seconds more, then add the caster sugar and tomato purée. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 6 tablespoons cold water and the cream and bring to a simmer. Season with salt, to taste.</li>

<li> Take the chicken out of the oven and stir in the creamy sauce. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
        

<li> Just before the chicken is done, roughly bash the cardamom pods in a pestle and mortar and remove the husks. Grind the seeds to a powder. Sprinkle the ground cardamom and remaining fenugreek over the butter chicken just before serving.</li>

      <ol>
         <li > Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
          <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
          <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
          <li> Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
